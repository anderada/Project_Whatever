Father: Alice, 
it's been a while since I last wrote letters to you, ever since your mother passed away... Your mother and I used to communicate like this back in college, even though we saw each other every day. We believe the words expressed through letters have their own power to deliver special emotions. It's unique, it's beautiful. I promise you that everything will be fine, even if there are only two of us now. Our life ahead is sunshine and summer breeze, broad and bright. As long as we live our best, your mother will be proud of both of us. I love you, Alice. 
Dear, Dad
