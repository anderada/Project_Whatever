Father: My most lovely precious Alice,
If you are reading this letter, I must have been away from you for whatever reasons. In my will, a trust fund will be created with my life savings, so there is nothing for you to be worried about. I am sorry I could not keep my promise and left you early. I know, I know how hard and grievance it must be for you. How unfair this world treats you. You must be so disappointed that Dad and Mom couldn't be there when you needed us. However, I feel lucky. Lucky that I have you as my daughter, lucky that I can watch you grow, lucky for the days we stayed together. I also feel bad I couldn't be there for the rest of your life, to be there and witness how high and far you can reach.
The agony of losing us is grave and cannot be simply erased. You don't have to suppress it or pretend it is not there. But after all, you still need to live a life, even if it is a life without us by your side. Time will heal your pain, but it will never weather my enteral love for you. I have faith that you will have a wonderful life ahead of you. Live your best, Mom and I will be proud, my Alice.
Ryan: Your Father, Ryan
