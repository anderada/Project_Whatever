Father: Dear daughter,
I know you overheard what your mother’s relatives were talking about yesterday. I heard it as well, “How can a widower take good care of his daughter?”. Hearing such words is indeed unpleasant on your 18th momentous birthday. However, I believe you are old enough to know this, I had a bad relationship with my father-in-law. 
He thinks I have ruined your mother’s life and led her astray. Your mother and I eloped to married and moved back several years later after your birth to fix the family relationships. Not the golden son-in-law, more like a pariah to the family of your mother's side. This changes nothing, and I don’t blame them for saying this. I just want you to understand, that we do not need to mind their word and be bothered by it. I promise to be a more responsible dad and love you forever.
Dad
