Father: Hey Alice! I'm sorry I couldn’t pick you up from your skating lesson today. The lecture I had was very important for my students, and I couldn’t miss it. I can’t wait to see you and hear all about your day! You can wait for me in the library on campus; Dad is friends with the librarian there, so make sure to be nice to her.
Ryan
