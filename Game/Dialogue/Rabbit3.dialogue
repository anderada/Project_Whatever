Rabbit: Well done, maiden. This journey is almost finished. Those retracting pillars must have been obnoxious, obstructing your path to here. 
Alice: They are creepy and give me shivers. When are you going to tell me what this place is?
Rabbit: I believe it's time for a small dose of disclosure and divulgence. This maze cages you, it is your very own mind. Sorrow and woe is its feed. 
Alice: Do you mean I am locked inside my own head? 
Rabbit: I speak no falsity, guaranteed. As absurd and unrealistic as it seems, yes, you are being hedged in this very place. Escape before the night ends; otherwise, you will be stranded and comatose eternally. 
Alice: Maybe…. this is not a bad decision. I don’t want to experience a life without my father by my side.
Rabbit: Oh, Alice, but ye must face it. Looking away the concrete decease cannot bring you resurrection and reunion. Yield not and bravely confront your dismay and hollowness.
Rabbit: To the tower, maiden, choose the path by your will there.
